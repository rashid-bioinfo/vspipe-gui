## Overview

VSpipe-GUI is a cross-platform, open-source Python toolkit that brings a user-friendly graphical interface to structure-based virtual screening. Originally developed as a command-line pipeline (VSpipe-CLI), VSpipe-GUI streamlines the virtual screening process, introduces spatial filtering to select hit compounds based on binding site interactions, and reduces computational overhead. For detailed background and performance benchmarks, please refer to our publication:
